what does this mean:
Correlatie Etage vs Aantal berichten met 'lift': 0.78

That line:

Correlatie Etage vs Aantal berichten met 'lift': 0.78


is showing the correlation coefficient between the floor number and the number of messages containing the keyword 'lift'. Let me break it down:

1. Correlation Coefficient

The value 0.78 is the Pearson correlation coefficient, which ranges from -1 to 1:

1 → perfect positive correlation (both increase together)

0 → no correlation (no linear relationship)

-1 → perfect negative correlation (one increases, the other decreases)

2. Interpretation in your context

Floor number (Etage) → the vertical floor in your flatgebouw.

Aantal berichten met 'lift' → how many messages mention the word “lift” per floor.

A correlation of 0.78 means:

There is a strong positive correlation.

Higher floors tend to send more messages mentioning "lift".

In other words, residents on higher floors talk about the lift more often than those on lower floors.

3. What it doesn’t tell you

Correlation does not imply causation. Higher floors talking more about lifts doesn’t mean the floor number causes more messages—it just shows a strong linear relationship.

It doesn’t tell you why higher floors mention the lift more. Maybe the lift is slower, or more people rely on it.

1. Positive Correlation (like your example 0.78)

What it looks like:

As the floor number increases, the number of messages mentioning the keyword also increases.

On a scatter plot with a regression line, points slope upwards from left to right.

Interpretation:

Higher floors talk more about that keyword.

Example: lift → residents on higher floors are more likely to complain or discuss the lift.

2. Negative Correlation (e.g., -0.65)

What it looks like:

As the floor number increases, the number of messages mentioning the keyword decreases.

Scatter plot slope goes downwards from left to right.

Interpretation:

Lower floors are more active regarding this topic.

Example: schoon (cleanliness) → maybe residents on lower floors complain more about cleaning issues.

3. Near-Zero Correlation (e.g., 0.05)

What it looks like:

Floor number and keyword messages show no consistent trend.

Scatter points are scattered randomly; regression line is almost flat.

Interpretation:

The discussion about this keyword is independent of floor number.

Example: camera → all floors discuss it roughly equally, no floor dominates the conversation.

Correlation	Scatter Plot Slope	What it Means
0.7–1.0	Upwards	Strong positive: higher floors more active
0.3–0.7	Slightly upwards	Moderate positive: small floor effect
-0.3–0.3	Flat	Weak or no correlation: floor doesn’t matter
-0.7–-1.0	Downwards	Strong negative: lower floors more active
